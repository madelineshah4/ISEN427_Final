In this project, we build a Bayesian logistic model to analyze the precision of calls made by MLB umpires. We work with datasets containing pitch information and umpire decisions for 3 individual umpires.

We build several Bayesian logistic models of precision for each umpire, each containing different subsets of important features. Then, we compare the models using the posterior predictive and determine the most relevant features in an umpire's decision.
